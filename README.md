# SO_AJ_SpringDynamicAdviceRegistration

The code for this sample project was taken from http://www.baeldung.com/spring-performance-logging
and its corresponding GitHub repo. Because the repo is huge and I only needed a small part of it,
I stripped it down and imported it into this repo in order to answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/49080647/1082681.

The project shows how to dynamically convert Spring beans into advised proxies and attach advisors to them.
BTW, advisors can also be detached dynamically.
